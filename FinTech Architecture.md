To address your request for a detailed high-level design and architecture diagram for a Bloomberg Terminal-like FinTech application, I’ll provide an in-depth explanation of each layer, component, and their connections, tailored for a professional tech forum presentation. The architecture will focus on meeting the requirements of a **latency-sensitive, data-intensive application** with a **React-based front end**, a **backend supporting multiple channels (REST, GraphQL, SSE, WebSockets, AI agents, MCP servers)**, and **real-time updates with universal type-ahead search**. I’ll also include specific technologies for each component and service, explain their connections, and provide a Lucidchart-compatible diagram in a text-based format that you can copy-paste into Lucidchart or similar tools (e.g., Draw.io, Visio) for professional visualization. Additionally, I’ll suggest how to download or export the diagram for presentation.
